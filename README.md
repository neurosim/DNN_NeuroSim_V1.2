# DNN+NeuroSim V1.2

The DNN+NeuroSim framework was developed by [Prof. Shimeng Yu's group](https://shimeng.ece.gatech.edu/) (Georgia Institute of Technology). The model is made publicly available on a non-commercial basis.

:star2: This is the released version 1.2 (Aug 8, 2020) for the tool, and this version has **_improved following inference engine estimation_**:
```
1. Calibrate FinFET technology library: temperature-related features.
2. Calibrate FinFET technology layout features.
```
:star2: This version has also added **_new features into inference accuracy estimation_**:
```
1. Introduce VSA-bsaed MLSA (in addition to the original CSA-based MLSA)
2. Introduce SAR ADC
```
:point_right: :point_right: :point_right: **In "Param.cpp", to switch ADC mode:**
```
SARADC = false;           // false: MLSA            // true: sar ADC
currentMode = true;       // false: MLSA use VSA    // true: MLSA use CSA
```

**_For estimation of on-chip training accelerators, please visit released V2.1 [DNN+NeuroSim V2.1](https://github.com/neurosim/DNN_NeuroSim_V2.1)_**

In Pytorch/Tensorflow wrapper, users are able to define **_network structures, precision of synaptic weight and neural activation_**. With the integrated NeuroSim which takes real traces from wrapper, the framework can support hierarchical organization from device level to circuit level, to chip level and to algorithm level, enabling **_instruction-accurate evaluation on both accuracy and hardware performance of inference_**.
